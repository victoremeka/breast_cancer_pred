Machine Learning Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
Model Persistence Method: Joblib
Live Application URL: [To be updated after deployment]
GitHub Repository: [To be updated after pushing to GitHub]
Features Selected: 
  1. mean radius - Mean of distances from center to points on perimeter
  2. mean texture - Standard deviation of gray-scale values
  3. mean perimeter - Mean size of the core tumor
  4. mean area - Mean area of the tumor
  5. mean smoothness - Mean of local variation in radius lengths

Additional Notes:
- Model trained using StandardScaler for feature normalization
- Achieved high accuracy and performance metrics
